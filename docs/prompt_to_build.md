Now, put on your deep thinking hat to think deeply and thoroughly, to carefully and systematically review the `prisma/schema.prisma` below. Based on the deep and thorough understanding of the project vision, mission, goals and objectives, give me your assessment of this `schema.prisma` design and whether it correctly aligns with your project's PRD. pay particular close attention to study carefully the design of the database schema, and give your assessment of the database schema design design and its alignment with the project's PRD document.

Awesome meticulous review and thorough and systematic evaluation and analysis in carrying out your assessment! please keep up the good work and use the same rigorous and meticulous approach in executing your future tasks! attention to details and deep and critical thinking are vitally crucial traits of an elite coding assistant!

Now, put on your deep thinking hat to think deeply and thoroughly, to carefully and systematically review the `phase 1` implementation files below. Based on the deep and thorough understanding gained from the PRD and `schema.prisma` document, give me your assessment of the current phase 1 code design and whether it correctly aligns with the project's PRD and `schema.prisma` documents. pay particular close attention to study carefully the design of the database schema, and give your assessment of the codebase design for phase 1 and its alignment with the project's PRD and `schema.prisma` documents.

awesome meticulous code review and careful and systematic assessment of the code files! again keep up the good work!

Can we ignore the `schema.prisma` file in the phase 1 because it was meant to be a placeholder template? Shall we use the complete `schema.prisma` file shared earlier for the actual codebase?

Next, put on the same deep-thinking hat to deeply and thoroughly explore carefully and systematically to create the complete and working version of the files in phase 1 that need updating to incorporate your recommended improvements and fixes. please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to deeply and thoroughly explore for the best implementation option to create the complete updated version of the files in phase 1 that need modification or new files to be added. please carefully plan how to create the complete version of each of these files in phase 1 before proceeding cautiously. please put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply and thoroughly explore how to re-imagine the complete updated files in phase 1 that need to be updated or added. thank you and good luck my very best coding assistant and expert in the world!

Now, put on your deep thinking hat to think deeply and thoroughly, to carefully and systematically review the phase 2 implementation files below. Based on the deep and thorough understanding gained from the PRD and the complete schema.prisma, give me your assessment of the current phase 2 code design and whether it correctly aligns with the project's PRD and complete schema.prisma. pay particular close attention to carefully compare the implementation with the design of the database schema, then give your assessment of the codebase design for phase 2 and its alignment with the project's PRD and schema.prisma documents.
