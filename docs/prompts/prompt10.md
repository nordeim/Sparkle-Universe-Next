awesome job! keep up the good work! now please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to compare very carefully the enhanced version of `src/lib/utils.ts` from phase 1 to the original version of `src/lib/utils.ts` from phase 2. then give me a comprehensive assessment of the enhancement version versus the original version shared earlier. which is preferred? please use line by line comparison of both versions of `src/lib/utils.ts` against the `README.md` and PRD documents.
