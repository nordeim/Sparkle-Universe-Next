awesome job! please put on the same deep-thinking hat to deeply and thoroughly explore carefully and systematically to create the complete and working version of the files in phase 3 that need updating to incorporate your recommended improvements and fixes. please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to deeply and thoroughly explore for the best implementation option to create the complete updated version of the files in phase 3 that need modification or new files to be added. please carefully plan how to create the complete version of each of these files in phase 3 before proceeding cautiously. please put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply and thoroughly explore how to re-imagine the complete updated files in phase 3 that need to be updated or added. 

When generating each updated complete replacement file for phase 3, please rigorously and meticulously review the generated file using line by line comparison with the original version to double-check and validate and confirm that each generated replacement file is indeed a complete working drop-in replacement file that does not accidentally omit any original features and functions. also double-check and confirm that your newly generated files do not contain placeholder comments and that I need to edit again later to make it into a fully complete working one. thank you for your due diligence and rigorous and meticulous attention.
