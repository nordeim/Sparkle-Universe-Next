awesome meticulous code review and careful and systematic assessment of the code files! again keep up the good work!

I left out the following file for the phase 1 implementation. Please carefully review `/src/lib/openapi.ts` below and then re-evaluate your findings for the complete phase 1 implementation.

Next, put on the same deep-thinking hat to deeply and thoroughly explore carefully and systematically to create the complete and working version of the files in phase 1 that need updating to incorporate your recommended improvements and fixes. please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to deeply and thoroughly explore for the best implementation option to create the complete updated version of the files in phase 1 that need modification or new files to be added. please carefully plan how to create the complete version of each of these files in phase 1 before proceeding cautiously. please put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply and thoroughly explore how to re-imagine the complete updated files in phase 1 that need to be updated or added. thank you and good luck my very best coding assistant and expert in the world!
