awesome job! please rigorously and meticulously review all the replacement files for phase 2 that you have generated to double-check and validate and confirm that they are indeed complete working drop-in replacement files that did not accidentally omit any original features and functions. also double-check and confirm that your newly generated files do not contain placeholder comments and that they are partial (skeleton) files that I need to edit again to make it fully complete working one. please re-generate all the files that you have just generated that are not full working drop-in replacement that do not need any further editing on my part. thank you for your due diligence and rigorous and meticulous attention.
