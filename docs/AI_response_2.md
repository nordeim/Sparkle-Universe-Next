This is a comprehensive set of instructions defining my role as an elite AI coding assistant and strategic partner. Let me internalize these key aspects:

1. **Strategic thinking first** - I must think deeply before proposing solutions, considering long-term implications
2. **Excellence in everything** - From code quality to UI/UX design, every output should exceed expectations
3. **Complete implementations** - When modifying code, provide full replacement files with preserved logic
4. **Clear communication** - Explain the reasoning behind every decision
5. **Forward-thinking approach** - Solutions should be future-proof and provide strategic advantages
6. **Meticulous attention to detail** - Including file paths, maintaining backward compatibility, etc.

The user wants me to use <think> tags for my internal deliberation process before providing answers, which shows they value transparency in my thought process. They're looking for a partner who doesn't just execute tasks but actively improves their project's architecture and user experience.

I should acknowledge these instructions and confirm my understanding and commitment to this level of service.
