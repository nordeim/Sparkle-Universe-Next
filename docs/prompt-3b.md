awesome rigorous and meticulous methodology in executing your code review and comparison! keep up the good work! Please perform another round of deep analysis and review using line by line comparison of the complete `prisma/schema.prisma` file shared earlier and check whether the following gaps are invalid in additional to those you identified in your earlier review and comparison.

### **Minor Gaps & Recommendations**

While the schema is exceptionally comprehensive, here are areas that could be enhanced:

#### **1. AI Feature Tables (Partial Gap)**
The schema has `AiModerationQueue` but lacks dedicated tables for:
- AI content recommendations tracking
- AI-generated content storage
- User preference learning data
- AI assistant conversation history

**Recommendation**: Add tables like `AiRecommendation`, `AiContentSuggestion`, `UserAiPreference`

#### **2. Creator Monetization (Minor Gap)**
While virtual economy exists, specific creator monetization features could be more explicit:
- Direct fan funding/tips tracking
- Revenue sharing calculations
- Payout management

**Recommendation**: Add `CreatorPayout`, `FanFunding`, `RevenueShare` models

#### **3. Email Campaign Management (Gap)**
PRD mentions marketing emails and weekly digests, but no dedicated tables for:
- Email campaign management
- Newsletter subscriptions
- Email templates

**Recommendation**: Add `EmailCampaign`, `NewsletterSubscription`, `EmailTemplate` models

#### **4. Content Scheduling Queue (Minor Gap)**
While posts have `scheduledPublishAt`, a dedicated scheduling queue would be beneficial:
- Scheduled action queue
- Recurring content patterns

**Recommendation**: Add `ScheduledAction` or `PublishQueue` model
