The provided configuration files are mostly correct and follow modern Next.js/React best practices, but there are a few issues to address:

### 1. Duplicate `next.config.ts` File
**Issue**: You have two identical `next.config.ts` files. This is redundant and could cause confusion.  
**Fix**: Keep only one `next.config.ts` (likely in the project root).

### 2. Tailwind Content Paths
**Potential Issue**: In `tailwind.config.cjs`, you include both `app` and `pages` directories:  
```cjs
"./src/app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
"./src/pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
```  
If you're using Next.js 13+ with the App Router, the `pages` directory might not exist. This is harmless but unnecessary if you're fully migrated to the App Router.

### 3. Dependency Version Alignment
**Observation**: All dependencies use recent versions, but ensure compatibility between:
- Next.js 15.4.6 (latest)
- React 19.1.1 (correct for Next.js 15)
- Prisma 6.14.0 (latest)
- TypeScript 5.9.2 (compatible)

### 4. CSS Variable Organization
**Improvement**: In `globals.css`, you define both `:root` and `.dark` variables. Consider using CSS nesting for better readability:
```css
@theme inline {
  /* ... */
}

:root {
  /* ... */
}

.dark {
  /* ... */
}
```

### 5. TypeScript Strictness
**Strength**: Your `tsconfig.json` has `strict: true`, which is excellent for code quality. The path aliases (`@/*`, `@/components/*`, etc.) are properly configured.

---

### Final Assessment
**Overall**: The configuration is **production-ready** and follows modern React/Next.js patterns. The only critical issue is the duplicate `next.config.ts`. The rest are minor optimizations or observations. 

**Recommendation**: Remove the duplicate `next.config.ts` and ensure your project structure matches the Tailwind content paths (e.g., delete `pages` references if using App Router).
