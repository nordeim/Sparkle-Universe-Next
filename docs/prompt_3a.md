Awesome meticulous review and thorough and systematic evaluation and analysis in carrying out your assessment! please keep up the good work and use the same rigorous and meticulous approach in executing your future tasks! attention to details and deep and critical thinking are vitally crucial traits of an elite coding assistant!

Now, please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to think deeply and thoroughly to explore carefully and systematically for the best implementation option to re-imagine a precision fix for the priority 1 issues you have identified. first carefully review the entire code for the `schema.prisma` to validate your findings, then create a detailed and careful step by step plan to make the necessary changes, add a checklist for each step. review your step-by-step execution plan for correctness and accuracy before processing. create a complete working replacement file for `schema.prisma` with version 4.2. finally use a line by line diff to do a careful comparison against the original version to ensure that no original features and functions have been accidentally omitted or lost. thank you and good luck!
