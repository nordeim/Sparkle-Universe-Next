awesome understanding! please put on your deep-thinking hat to think deeply and thoroughly in doing a careful and systematic review of the attached `prisma/schema.prisma` for my project. using a line by line comparison to do a very thorough, rigorous and meticulous code review of the structure of the schema file, check and validate its syntax, correctness and accuracy. and give me your comprehensive assessment report on your code review process, your deep understanding of its structure and key features, any coding and logic errors, and inconsistencies. also include in your deep assessment report your findings and recommendations. please very thorough, rigorous and meticulous in your approach. plan your code review and analysis approach first before proceeding. thank you and good luck, my very best coding assistant in the world!

Awesome meticulous review and thorough and systematic evaluation and analysis in carrying out your assessment! please keep up the good work and use the same rigorous and meticulous approach in executing your future tasks! attention to details and deep and critical thinking are vitally crucial traits of an elite coding assistant!

Now, please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to think deeply and thoroughly to explore carefully and systematically for the best implementation option to re-imagine a precision fix for the priority 1 issues you have identified. first carefully review the entire code for the `schema.prisma` to validate your findings, then create a detailed and careful step by step plan to make the necessary changes, add a checklist for each step. review your step-by-sep execution plan for correctness and accuracy before processing. create a complete working replacement file for `schema.prisma` with version 3.5. finally use a line by line diff to do a careful comparison against the original version to ensure that no original features and functions have been accidentally omitted or lost. thank you and good luck!
